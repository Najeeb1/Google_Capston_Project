## Introduction: 
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks as a data analyst. To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

#### Background: 
Cyclistic: A bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use bikes to commute to work each day.

#### problem statement: 
You are a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes?
2. Whywouldcasualriders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. HowcanCyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? Moreno has assigned you the question to answer: How do annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Prepare: 

I have worked with two different types of datasets. a) quarterly ridership of 2019 and 2020. b) all 12 months of 2023. 
Every analysis and visualization belongs to the first dataset. Only the Preprocess file done with Python belongs to the second one. 
The reason for the later part was to be able to work with complex SQL queries. However, Google BigQuery limit exceeds very fast. 
I picked Pandas to do it for free. 

## Process: 
In the processing part, I have done mostly cleaning and combining datasets and having an overview of the data. Feel free to check them here:
